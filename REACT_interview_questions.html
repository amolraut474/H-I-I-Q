                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user
                        interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable
                        UI components.

                        Component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.
                        Unidirectional data flow with Flux/Redux for managing state.
                        React Native for building mobile applications.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript
                        that allows developers to write HTML-like code in React components. JSX gets compiled to
                        JavaScript code that React can understand.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in memory. When
                        there are updates to the UI, React first updates the Virtual DOM instead of the actual DOM.
                        Then, it calculates the difference between the previous Virtual DOM and the updated Virtual DOM
                        (reconciliation) and applies only the necessary changes to the actual DOM, resulting in improved
                        performance.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are
                        reusable, independent pieces of UI that can be composed together to create complex UIs.
                        Components can be either functional (stateless) or class-based (stateful).
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> State is managed within a component and can be modified over time. It is
                        mutable.
                        Props (short for properties) are passed to a component from its parent and remain fixed
                        throughout the component's lifecycle. They are immutable.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Keys are used to uniquely identify elements in an array of JSX elements.
                        They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. Keys should be
                        stable, unique, and consistent.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> setState() is used to update the state of a component. It merges the
                        provided object into the component's current state and triggers a re-render of the component and
                        its children with the updated state.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Controlled components are components whose form elements (like inputs,
                        selects, and textareas) are controlled by React state. Changes to the input values are handled
                        by React, and the component's state is updated accordingly.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React Router is a routing library for React applications. It enables
                        navigation and routing in single-page applications by mapping URLs to different React
                        components. It provides components like ,BrowserRouter, ,Route, and ,Link, for defining routes
                        and navigating between them.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features
                        in functional components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a
                        class. The most commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>useEffect is used to perform side effects in functional components. It
                        combines componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in a single hook. It
                        takes two arguments: a function and an optional array of dependencies. The function runs after
                        every render, and the dependencies array allows you to specify when the effect should run.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It
                        helps manage the state of an application in a predictable way by enforcing a strict
                        unidirectional data flow. React interacts with Redux using the react-redux library, which
                        provides components like Provider and connect to integrate Redux with React components.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called render().
                        The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML
                        element. In the render() method, we can read props and state and return our JSX code to the root
                        component of our app.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called
                        props (which stands for properties). Props are objects which can be used inside a component
                        We can access any props inside from the component’s class to which the props is passed. The
                        props can be accessed as shown below:
                        this.props.propName;

                        to Component. It is also known as one-way data flow, which means the data has one, and only one
                        way to be transferred to other parts of the application. In essence, this means child components
                        are not able to update the data that is coming from the parent component. It is easy to debug
                        and less prone to errors.

                        states from one component to another irrespective of their position in the component tree and
                        hence prevents the complexity of the application. As the number of components in our application
                        increases it becomes difficult to pass state as props to multiple components. To overcome this
                        situation we use react-redux

                        important ones are as mentioned below:
                        React makes use of a single-direction data flow model.
                        It deals with complete server-side data processing and handling.
                        React uses a Virtual DOM, which has many advantages of its own.

                     <h2><span>questions:-</span>What is the difference between .js and .jsx files in React.js?
                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>In React.js, both .js and .jsx files are used to write JavaScript code for
                        React components. However, there is a convention to use .jsx file extension for files that
                        contain JSX syntax, while .js extension is typically used for regular JavaScript files.
                        .js Files:
                        Files with a .js extension are regular JavaScript files that can contain JavaScript code,
                        including React components written using JSX. However, JSX syntax is not natively recognized by
                        JavaScript engines, so in order to use JSX in .js files, a preprocessor like Babel is required
                        to transpile JSX code into regular JavaScript.
                        .jsx Files:
                        Files with a .jsx extension are also JavaScript files, but they are specifically intended for
                        React components written using JSX syntax. JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to
                        write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to describe UI components. JSX code is
                        transformed into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel, which converts JSX elements into
                        React.createElement() function calls.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>The setState() method is used to update the state of a component in React.
                        When setState() is called, React re-renders the component and its children with the updated

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>(1)Virtual DOM:
                        React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI. By comparing the virtual DOM with the
                        real DOM and only updating the parts that have changed, React minimizes the number of DOM
                        manipulations, resulting in improved performance and faster rendering.
                        (2)Component-Based Architecture:
                        React follows a component-based architecture, where UIs are composed of reusable and composable
                        components. Components encapsulate both UI and behavior, making code organization and
                        maintenance easier. This approach promotes reusability, modularity, and scalability, allowing
                        developers to build complex UIs by composing smaller components.
                        (3)JSX (JavaScript XML):
                        JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within
                        JavaScript. JSX simplifies the process of defining React components by enabling the mixing of UI
                        elements and JavaScript logic in a single file. It improves code readability, reduces syntax
                        errors, and facilitates the development of UIs.
                        (4)Unidirectional Data Flow:
                        React follows a unidirectional data flow architecture, where data flows in a single direction
                        from parent components to child components. This ensures predictable data flow and makes it
                        easier to debug and reason about the application's state. Unidirectional data flow also helps
                        prevent unexpected side effects and makes the application more maintainable.
                        (5)State Management:
                        React provides a mechanism for managing component state, allowing components to maintain their
                        own internal state. State is used to represent data that can change over time, such as user
                        input or UI interactions. By managing state at the component level, React enables the creation
                        of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
                        (6)Reusable Components:
                        React encourages the creation of reusable components, which can be easily shared and composed to
                        build complex UIs. Components encapsulate both UI and behavior, making them self-contained and
                        portable. Reusable components promote code reusability, reduce duplication, and accelerate
                        development time.
                        (7)React Hooks:
                        React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features
                        without writing a class. Hooks enable functional components to have local state, side effects,
                        and access to React lifecycle methods. They provide a more intuitive way to manage state and
                        lifecycle in functional components, making them more powerful and flexible.
                        (8)Large Ecosystem and Community Support:
                        React has a large and active community of developers, which contributes to its extensive
                        ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources. The React ecosystem includes popular libraries
                        like React Router for routing, Redux for state management, and React Native for building
                        cross-platform mobile apps. The vibrant community provides support, documentation, and regular
                        updates, ensuring the longevity and stability of React.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Higher-order components (HOCs) are a powerful feature of the React
                        library. They allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components. In React, a
                        higher-order component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new
                        component that wraps the original component.

                        It's like a function that just takes some inputs (props) and returns what the UI should look
                        like based on those inputs. It's simple and focused on displaying information.
                        Stateful Component: Unlike the stateless one, this component does have a memory. It can keep
                        track of information (state) and use that information to change what it shows in the UI. It's
                        more like a dynamic entity that can respond to user input or other events.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and
                        manipulate during its three main phases.
                        The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
                        Mounting:-Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
                        React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:
                        constructor():-The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is
                        initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.
                        getDerivedStateFromProps():-The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before
                        rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
                        render():-The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to
                        the DOM.
                        componentDidMount():-The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
                        render:-
                        The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.
                        Updating:-The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.
                        A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
                        React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:
                        getDerivedStateFromProps():-Also at updates the getDerivedStateFromProps method is called. This
                        is the first method that is called when a component gets updated.
                        shouldComponentUpdate():-In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value
                        that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
                        render():-The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to
                        re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes.
                        The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue:
                        getSnapshotBeforeUpdate():-In the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method you have access to the props
                        and state before the update, meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values
                        were before the update.
                        componentDidUpdate():-The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in
                        the DOM.
                        The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be
                        called if you define them
                        Unmounting:-The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or
                        unmounting as React likes to call it.React has only one built-in method that gets called when a
                        component is unmounted:
                        componentWillUnmount():-The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to
                        be removed from the DOM.
