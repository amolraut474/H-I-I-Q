                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.

                        Virtual DOM for efficient rendering.
                        Component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.
                        Unidirectional data flow with Flux/Redux for managing state.
                        React Native for building mobile applications.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in React components. JSX gets compiled to JavaScript code that React can understand.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in memory. When there are updates to the UI, React first updates the Virtual DOM instead of the actual DOM. Then, it calculates the difference between the previous Virtual DOM and the updated Virtual DOM (reconciliation) and applies only the necessary changes to the actual DOM, resulting in improved performance.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, independent pieces of UI that can be composed together to create complex UIs. Components can be either functional (stateless) or class-based (stateful).

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> State is managed within a component and can be modified over time. It is mutable.
                        Props (short for properties) are passed to a component from its parent and remain fixed throughout the component's lifecycle. They are immutable.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Keys are used to uniquely identify elements in an array of JSX elements. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. Keys should be stable, unique, and consistent.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> setState() is used to update the state of a component. It merges the provided object into the component's current state and triggers a re-render of the component and its children with the updated state.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Controlled components are components whose form elements (like inputs, selects, and textareas) are controlled by React state. Changes to the input values are handled by React, and the component's state is updated accordingly.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React Router is a routing library for React applications. It enables navigation and routing in single-page applications by mapping URLs to different React components. It provides components like ,BrowserRouter, ,Route, and ,Link, for defining routes and navigating between them.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. The most commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>useEffect is used to perform side effects in functional components. It combines componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in a single hook. It takes two arguments: a function and an optional array of dependencies. The function runs after every render, and the dependencies array allows you to specify when the effect should run.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the state of an application in a predictable way by enforcing a strict unidirectional data flow. React interacts with Redux using the react-redux library, which provides components like Provider and connect to integrate Redux with React components.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called render(). The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element. In the render() method, we can read props and state and return our JSX code to the root component of our app.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (which stands for properties). Props are objects which can be used inside a component
                        We can access any props inside from the component’s class to which the props is passed. The props can be accessed as shown below:
                        this.props.propName;

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>ReactJS uses one-way data binding which can be Component to View or View to Component. It is also known as one-way data flow, which means the data has one, and only one way to be transferred to other parts of the application. In essence, this means child components are not able to update the data that is coming from the parent component. It is easy to debug and less prone to errors.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>React has multiple features that are used for unique purposes. The important ones are as mentioned below:
                        React makes use of a single-direction data flow model.
                        It deals with complete server-side data processing and handling.
                        React uses a Virtual DOM, which has many advantages of its own.

                     <h2><span>questions:-</span>What is the difference between .js and .jsx files in React.js?
                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>In React.js, both .js and .jsx files are used to write JavaScript code for React components. However, there is a convention to use .jsx file extension for files that contain JSX syntax, while .js extension is typically used for regular JavaScript files.
                        .js Files:
                        Files with a .js extension are regular JavaScript files that can contain JavaScript code, including React components written using JSX. However, JSX syntax is not natively recognized by JavaScript engines, so in order to use JSX in .js files, a preprocessor like Babel is required to transpile JSX code into regular JavaScript.
                        .jsx Files:
                        Files with a .jsx extension are also JavaScript files, but they are specifically intended for React components written using JSX syntax. JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to describe UI components. JSX code is transformed into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel, which converts JSX elements into React.createElement() function calls.
